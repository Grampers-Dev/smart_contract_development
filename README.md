# Encouragement Token

*(To give courage, strength, and purpose)*

Encouragement is the act of raising confidence by extending one's agency. Our unique tokenomics are designed to give real-world utility while providing passive income.

## Abstract

The Encouragement token (XEAM) is a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that aims to create a more transparent and fair global economy. With blockchain technology, XEAM offers a secure, fast, and cost-effective way to transfer value worldwide.

The tokenomics of XEAM are designed to promote community growth and long-term sustainability. Out of a total supply of two million tokens, allocations are made to the following areas:

- Development
- Marketing
- Staking
- Ecosystem
- Encouragement Fund
- Emergency Fund
- Community Building

A key feature of XEAM is that 4% of all trading fees go to the **Encouragement Fund**, providing passive income for NGOs and food banks. Additionally, 1% of transaction fees go to an **Emergency Fund**, governed by the community through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

For those looking to invest in the future of blockchain technology, XEAM offers strong tokenomics, a commitment to community growth, and a focus on social responsibility.

## The Giving Block Partnership

Born in Dublin, Ireland, XEAM faced initial resistance from local NGOs due to uncertainty around crypto. To overcome this, we partnered with **The Giving Block**, a platform specializing in cryptocurrency donations.

Through their **Crypto Adoption Fund**, The Giving Block pools thousands of charities into a single fund, creating a more equitable distribution of resources. This partnership amplifies our mission and demonstrates the power of blockchain for social good.

## What Lies Ahead?

Together, we can make a real difference. As technology evolves and regulations shift, we will adapt and grow our ecosystem to stay at the forefront of innovation and social impact.

**So let's do this, XEAM ARMY!**
